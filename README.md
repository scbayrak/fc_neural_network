# fc_neural_network
 Fc_neural_network implementation without ML libraries

 A multi-layer neural network for classification of MNIST dataset was implemented using mostly Numpy:
• Fully parameterizable neural network (number and types of layers, number of units, activation functions, optimizer, mini-batch size etc)
• Sigmoid and relu layers (with forward and backward pass)
• Softmax output layer
• SGD and Adam optimizer and validation loss stopping
• Trainable via backpropagation.
